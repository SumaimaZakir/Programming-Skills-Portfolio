Chapter 3 Exercise 4 Guest list
If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d

like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
"""
guest = ['Mike', 'Sara', 'John'] # list of 3 guests

print("Would you like to go to dinner with me,", guest[0], "?") #prints the invite to the first guest
print("Would you like to go to dinner with me,", guest[1], "?") #prints the invite to the second guest
print("Would you like to go to dinner with me,", guest[2], "?\n") #prints the invite to the third guest and creates a new line

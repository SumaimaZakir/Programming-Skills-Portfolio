Chapter 3 Exercise 2 Greetings
Start with the list you used in Exercise 1, but instead of just

printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be

personalized with the person’s name.
"""
name = ['Mike', 'Sara', 'John'] #a list of 3 names
print("I hope you're good,",name[0]) #prints the message with the first name
print("I hope you're good,",name[1]) #prints the message with the second name
print("I hope you're good,",name[2]) #prints the message with the third name
